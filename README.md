# DDS_Container_Question
***WARNING*** I messed up the password for clone.sh. it is theempiredidnothingwrong instead of empiredidnothingwrong
This project includes the following files:
1. Dockerfile: This file configures the docker container. Originally, the container ran only 
2. docker-compose: I do not think this file is actually necessary (I didn't end up using gitea, which I will discuss later) but for some reason it worked when I did it that way and not when I ran it with a run command. Chances are I was just missing an option or two, but it seemed more prudent to worry about other parts of the project before fixing this small inefficiency. Furthermore, docker-compose makes stopping and cleaning associated containers and resources simpler, meaning it saved me work in the end.
